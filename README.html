How many times has the electoral college failed the general population for the presidential election in the United States? 
</p>
<p>

   With Donald Trumps recent victory, millions of Americans are scratching their heads wondering how did he manage to win the electoral vote by a landslide, but lost the popular vote by almost one million? This is because of the disproportionality of our electoral college, something that was designed to prevent candidates such as Trump from winning. 
Of course, Trump still won, such is politics, and this is why.

    The amount of electoral votes a state has in an election is based on the number of seats that they have in the House of Representatives plus the number of Senators that each state has. While the amount of representatives a state has is based on the states population, the number of senators a state has remains constant for all states, two. This means every state has at least three electoral votes, no matter how small the population is. While this does not seem like a problem, it means states with smaller populations technically have more of a say than states with larger populations. Take Wyoming for instance, a voter from Wyoming has four times the vote of a voter from California. That means that a Wyoming vote is equivalent to four California votes. 
This kind of disproportionality has led to several times in American history where a president wins the electoral vote, but did not win the popular vote. Instances of this are in the elections of:

	In order to prevent these kind of elections in the future, Constitutional amendment must be made to abolish the electoral college, because right now, it has a bias towards smaller states. The electoral college was designed to prevent someone like Donald Trump from winning, however, he relied on that very institution to win the election.
